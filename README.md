# Node.js Playground 🏗️  

**Welcome to my Node.js Playground!**  

**This repository is a collection of code snippets, projects, and exercises that I’ve built while learning and practicing Node.js. It covers a variety of topics, including server creation, APIs, databases, and useful built-in or third-party modules. I’ve also tried to make the programs do cool and challenging things to push my learning further.** 🚀

The repository is organized into folders based on topics:  

- **modules/** – Exploring both built-in and external Node.js modules.  
- **server/** – Basic and advanced server implementations.  
- **api/** – API-related code.  
- **db/** – Database interactions using different technologies.  
- **other/** – Miscellaneous experiments and learning exercises.  

## 🚀 Purpose  
This repository serves as my personal learning space, but feel free to explore and get inspired!  

## 📌 Notes
